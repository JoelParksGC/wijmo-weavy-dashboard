## Getting Started

This application is built with webpack used to bundle the Handlebars, JavaScript, and CSS files. It uses a NodeJS/Express backend to serve the bundled files. It is pre-configured to use Wijmo and Weavy libraries. Clone this repo, making sure that you have [Node and NPM installed](https://nodejs.org/). Intsall the dependencies and then you'll be able to build the application.

To run the application, run the following commands:
- npm install
- npm run build
- npm run start

Building the application will create a set of JS and CSS bundles, as well as HTML files in the dist folder. Running the application will start a NodeJS server on port 3000.
